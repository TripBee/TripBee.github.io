# San_Francisco_GeoJSON_Mapping
In this project, we are mapping information that someone would care about if they were moving to San Francisco. 

Take a look at the Layering options on the upper right-hand corner of the map. There you will find several different coloring options for the map and several datasets that you can toggle on and off. 

The next step in the project is to make the Map Markers different for each dataset. 

The coloring options are pulled from MapBox, the data is from catalog.data.gov or data.sfgoc.org, the datasets were originallyt csvs that I converted into JSON files and lastly into JavaScript objects. The plotting is done using Leaflet.js. Most files are loaded in html and all functionality is done in JavaScript.
