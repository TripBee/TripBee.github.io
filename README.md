I am an analyst on the San Francisco peninsula and am always looking for new opportunities

Here are links to some of my recent projects, check them out!

## Bike Sharing Analysis
I used Kaggle to find a dataset of a few tens of thousands of observations of trips with Citi Bikeâ€™s rental bicycles. I used MySQL workbench to feel out the state of the dataset using queries. I then used Zepl to clean and format the data. Then I used tableau to generate graphics and map the quantity, time, and location of the trips in the city.

## Live GeoMapping of Reported Earthquakes
In this project I run a script to request earthquake reports from the USGS. Then I display them on an interactive map.

## Public Wi-Fi Hotspots vs Income Level
I am fairly interested in the difference in the quality of public services in high income areas verses low income areas, so I found a dataset on the publicly available Wi-Fi hotspots in New York and mapped them over a layer of 2018 income stats at the city block level. This is one of my visuals.
